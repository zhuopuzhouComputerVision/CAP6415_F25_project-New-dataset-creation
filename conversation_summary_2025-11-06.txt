YOLO Custom Training Session Summary (2025-11-06)

1. Project Setup:
- Discussed minimal file structure for YOLO training on custom data.
- Created scripts to rename images and convert LabelMe JSONs to YOLO TXT format.
- Split dataset into train/val/test and generated data.yaml.

2. Training:
- Trained YOLOv8 model using the prepared dataset.
- Achieved high precision, recall, and mAP metrics.

3. Evaluation & Inference:
- Evaluated model on validation set with visualizations (confusion matrix, PR/F1 curves, etc.).
- Ran inference on test images and saved visualized predictions.

4. Metrics & Visualizations Explained:
- Explained box loss, class loss, DFL, precision, recall, mAP@0.5, mAP@0.5:0.95, and F1-confidence curve.
- Discussed confidence thresholds and how to select the optimal value.

5. Example F1-Confidence Curve:
- Showed how to interpret the curve and select the best threshold (e.g., 0.314 for max F1).

6. Next Steps:
- Provided scripts for evaluation and inference.
- Explained how to use results and what each metric/visualization means.

This summary can be used to recall the workflow, scripts, and key concepts discussed in this session.
